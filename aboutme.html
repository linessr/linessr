          <p>Hello, my name is Lines and I am from Providence, Rhode Island. I'm a student at the University of Rhode Island. I have a 1 year old son named Leandro.<br>
              I love working out and watching Netflix shows when I have time. I was born in Puerto Rico and came to the United States when I was 15 years old. I love <br>
              the color blue and brown. I also enjoy going for hikes and eating different foods. On my freetime I also make earrings from polymer clay. </p>
